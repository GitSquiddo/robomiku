# RoboMiku

### Say hello to RoboMiku.

She is a new bot that is being made in JavaScript using the [Discord.js](https://discordjs.org/) addon.

All commands only use `!` as a prefix.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ping | Sends a random and (probably) useless message. |
| hello | RoboMiku says hello to you! ~~What, too simple?~~ |
| clear | Clears the given number of messages. *Only those with a special role can use this.* |
| profile | Shows your "profile" with your username and bio. |
| setBio (Beta) | Changes your profile's bio to your given answer. |
| mew | Mew at the given user. Just make sure it isn't a bot! |
| gif | Gives a random GIF to the user. ~~All GIFs used are from Giphy!~~ |
| fact | Get some (probably) useless facts. |

**More to come soon!**

RoboMiku is still in a very early alpha, so please *don't insult her!* I try to make her better whenever I can.

~~Who needs school? *Psh.*~~
